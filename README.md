This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was created with the intention so seek a playlist from the Last.fm API and getting the title from there, fetch that title, search it on youtube and show the first result in a floating component on the same page.

It was programmed with Hooks and the request to the APIs were done with Axios.

When you clone the repository, you first need to `npm install` and then `npm start`
